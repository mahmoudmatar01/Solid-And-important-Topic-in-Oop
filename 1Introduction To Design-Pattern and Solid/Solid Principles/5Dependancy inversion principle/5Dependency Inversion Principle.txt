			" Dependency Inversion Principle "


1- Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. 
     It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, 
     but they should depend on abstractions.

2- dont make all class depand on high level class make an Abstractions between them 


3- to do it below ( constructor - method - attribute )
