//                              (Polymorphism)
//   1- The word polymorphism means having many forms.
//   2- In object-oriented programming paradigm, polymorphism is often expressed as 'one interface, multiple functions'. 
//   3- Polymorphism can be static or dynamic. In static polymorphism, the response to a function is determined at the compile time
//   4- it is decided at run-time.

//  "Static Polymorphism":-

//      * The mechanism of linking a function with an object during compile time is called early 
//        binding. It is also called static binding. C# provides two techniques to implement static 
//        polymorphism. They are âˆ’
              // -Function overloading 
              // -Operator overloading


//  " Function Overloading ":-
//     * You can have multiple definitions for the same function name in the same scope. The 
//       definition of the function must differ from each other by the types and/or the number of 
//       arguments in the argument list .
//     * You cannot overload function declarations that differ only by return type



// class Atributes
protected int width;
protected int length;


// class constructor 
public Shape(int len,int wid){
    this.length=len;
    this.width=wid;
}


public int Area(){
    Console.WriteLine("Area of this Shape");
    return this.length*this.width;
}
